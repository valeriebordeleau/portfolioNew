        Objective and Background
        </h6>
        <p class="gutter push-half">The objective of this project was to create cohesive marketing materials (and fundraising merchandise) for the <em>Canadian Veterinarian Medical Association's</em> annual <em>Animal Health Week</em>. This year the theme was <em> Animal Welfare: Safeguarding the Five Animal Freedoms</em>.</p> 

        <p class="gutter">This project was completed during my contract with <a href="https://simzerdesign.com/" class="reference">Simzer Design</a>, the key Project Manger was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmelvinottawa/" class="reference">Matt Melvin.</a> </p>

        Rough Sketches
        </h6>
            <p class="gutter">
The first phase in this project was a multitude of pencil sketches for the primary illustrative logo. As <em>CVMA</em> treats a multitude of types of animals, representation was pivotal.

        Art Direction and Illustration
        </h6>
            <p class="gutter">Art direction for this project had to appeal to a wide audience, from veterinarians to their clients, both farm animal owners and pet families. For this reason, I went with a bright, bold and family-friendly approach. My concept comprises of 5 animals, representing the diversity of the veterinarians’ scope of care. Each animal in the logo corresponds to both a colour, and elsewhere in the campaign, one of the <em>five freedoms</em>.</p>
