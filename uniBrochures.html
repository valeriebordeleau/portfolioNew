        Objective and Background
        </h6>
        <p class="gutter push-half">During my time at <a href="https://simzerdesign.com/" class="reference">Simzer Design</a>, I was tasked with creating a standard look for a series of brochures for Centre for Continued Education at the University of Ottawa that was both on-brand for the university and recognizable as the Continued Education. 
            
        <p class="gutter push">The key Project Manger was Steve Simzer.</p>

        Layout Sketches
        </h6>
            <p class="gutter">
I began this project by sketching out a series of possible layouts for both the cover and interior layout, based on the initial content provided by the client.

        Cover Concepts
        </h6>
            <p class="gutter">Initially, before final content was written, we pitched concepts for covers. While some elements were required to be present in all university material (logo placement, base border etc.), we were asked to break the mould of the previously templated covers, used previously. Of these options, <em>Option A</em> was selected.</p>

            <p class="gutter">Each organization within Continued Education required its own 4-page brochure.  We began by with the <em> Canadian Centre of Excellence for Anti-Corruption</em> as model for future brochures. </p>

            <p class="gutter">As each organization had slightly different marketing goals, demographics and content, the layout had to be flexible to suit these needs. Here is a layout for the <em>Institute for Strategic Communications and Change</em></p>
