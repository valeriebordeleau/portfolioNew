- title: Hideaway Hotel

  blurb1: Hideaway Hotel helps combat domestic violence by connecting victims of abuse, who need a place to go, with free short-term hotel rooms, paid for with a portion of patronâ€™s booking fees.  

  blurb2: I began my research by speaking with people impacted by domestic violence. This helped me sketch out a flow chart based on reoccurring pain points and identify a target audience; women in urban settings between the ages of 25-45. One of the most common challenges many had was finding a place to stay.
  
  blurb3: Finding a free hotel room for users in their time of crisis is this apps' primary goal. Honing in on their location with GPS, Hideaway Hotel generates a list of nearby participating hotels.
  
  blurb4: Booking a room requires no personal information and can be done quickly on the go. Providing a password that can be referenced at check in allows the user privacy. 
  
  blurb5: I then created a demo in After Effects to demonstrate the look and feel of the final product.
