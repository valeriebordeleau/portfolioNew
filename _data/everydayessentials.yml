- title: Everyday Essentials
  blurb1: This project is an environmentally friendly redesign of an existing packaging for Everyday Essentials Halogen Light bulb. The original design was a hanging product comprised of two thick plastic sheets sealed with one tiny glue dot.
  blurb2: My take on the brandâ€™s packaging eliminates all plastic, instead opting for recyclable paper products. I also chose a stackable design rather than a hanging one as it would allow more products to be displayed with less chance of damage caused by falls.
