- title: Animated Icon Set

  blurb1: The objective of this project was to create a series of icons with that animate when pressed. They were original created within the context of an app which randomly generates a list of activities/places to go when bored. 

  blurb2: Each icon has both a passive and active state. Icons are in a passive state before use or while not preforming an action. This project began by creating illustrations for these states.
  
  blurb3: Animations are initiated when icons enter their active state. This state indicates an action is being preformed.
  
  blurb4: A brief demo to visualize the transition between these two states was then made.
