- title: A Novel Idea
  blurb1: The goal of this personal project was to create an illustrative textile and word mark to brand the classic novel Animal Farm by George Orwell, which could be easily translated across various commercial media. This project is part of an ongoing series, inspired by my most recent favourite reads. As such creating a repeatable style was the main challenge.
  blurb2: I began by taking a trip to local bookstore to take photos the various stationary and decorative pieces they sold. I then did some sketches of how branding might be applied to some of these objects.
  blurb3: I then created ink illustrations for a few of the novels I had read recently, using pointillism to capture the classic mood.
  blurb4: Next I digitized the illustration to create a textile and developed a flexible word mark.
