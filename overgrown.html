        Overview
        </h6>
        <p class="gutter push-half"><em> Overgrown </em>is a collection of several of my personal illustrations which stylistically lended themselves to the format of a colouring book. Floral and botanical elements are a running theme tying the selection together.</p>

        First Sample Spread
        </h6>
        <p class="gutter push-half">Each spread consists of one character illustration and a repeating pattern. A square format and the play on positive and negative space within each spread, was selected to make this particular colouring book a little unconventional. As so often these products start to look quite similar, differentiated only by their subject matter, the slightly tweaked formatting provides a uniqueness to the product.</p>

        Second Sample Spread
        </h6>
            <p class="gutter">As in this example, some of the pattern selections are interlocking, creating vine-like imagery. The elements in each pattern are comprised of elements from their corresponding illustration.</p>

    <div class="unit unit-s-1 unit-l-1-2 projectText pad-b-2">
          <h6 class="gutter push-0" id="top" href="{{site.baseurl}}/">Third Spread</h6>
            <p class="gutter">Spreads flip in order from one spread to the next, the pattern being on the left and character on the right, then the inverse. This is to allow the character illustrations to always lead inward.</p>
        </div>
    
    <div class="unit unit-s-1 unit-l-1-2">
        <img src="/artwork/overgrown_4.jpg"  class="embed pad-bottom">

     <div class="unit unit-s-1 unit-l-1-2 projectText pad-b-2">
          <h6 class="gutter push-0" id="top" href="{{site.baseurl}}/">Fourth Sample Spread</h6>
            <p class="gutter">The subjects of  each illustration is meant to be slightly tweaked, off-kilter versions of animals and people with that bizarre botanical twist. This choice, creates interesting and unusual shapes for the prospective <em> colourist</em>.</p>

          <h6 class="gutter push-0" id="top" href="{{site.baseurl}}/">Final Sample Spread</h6>
            <p class="gutter">This spread is another example of the interlocking pattern. Elements from the bear’s ear vine were intertwined with the vines wrapping around his mid section to create it.</p>
